# Maze generation algorithms

#### 2 algorithms were implemented to generate random mazes. The first one is [Randomized Prim algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Iterative_randomized_Prim's_algorithm_(without_stack,_without_sets)), and the second one is [Wilson's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Wilson's_algorithm).   
The labyrinths are generated and then transformed into 3D models under .scad format. Here is an example of what it can look like:
